## Hello! 👋
My name is Melissa Herrera. I am currently a Developer Advocate at [Temporal](temporal.io) 💻

## Video Content 📹
Through my previous tenure at DataStax/Langflow, I was able to explore topics from OSS Apache Cassandra, cloud-native technologies, vector embeddings/RAG, and Generative AI concepts. This a display of me not only building in public, but _learning_ in public.
